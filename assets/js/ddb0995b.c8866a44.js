In this article I will write about the history of LIPS\\nScheme interpreter.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What is Scheme?\\n\\nScheme is a dialect of the Lisp. The second oldest programming language still in use (after\\nFortran).  Lisp and Scheme have specific syntax with prefix notation and where everything is a list.\\nIt\'s also [Homoiconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity), which means that code and data\\nhave the same represantion. This allows to write lisp (and Scheme) programs that modify the code\\nlike it was data.\\n\\n## What is LIPS?\\n\\nLIPS name is a recursive ancronym which stands for \\"LIPS Is Pretty Simple\\". LIPS Scheme is implementation of\\nScheme programming language in JavaScript. It adds a lot of stuff on top of Scheme to make it more powerful\\nand easier to interact with JavaScript.\\n\\n## History of LIPS\\n\\nIt all started in February of 2018. I\'ve written the first version of Lisp interpreter. You can\\nstill see the code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jcubic/pen/gvvzdp). Then I moved the\\n[devlopment to GitHub](https://github.com/jcubic/lips) and created a name LIPS.  The first release\\n(version 0.2.0) is marked as Mar 2018.\\n\\nAt the begining it was Lisp based on Scheme, but at one point after version\\n[0.20.1 dated as Jul 1, 2020](https://github.com/jcubic/lips/releases/tag/0.20.1). I\'ve starting\\nadding features on devel branch and decided that I want full Scheme implementation. But it turns out that there are\\nway to many breaking changes to release next version. So I decided that I will release it as beta-1.0. Since then LIPS keeps introducing new Beta version. You can see the [latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/jcubic/lips/releases).\\n\\n## Future of LIPS\\nFor the future plans I want in version 1.0 are implementation of continutations and <abbr\\ntitle=\\"Tail Call Optimization\\">TCO</abbr>. To see the progress you can check\\n[1.0 Milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/jcubic/lips/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.0)."}]}')}}]);
